# Mellon

# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide users with a pared down microblogging experience. Many social media platforms in the current day place a strong emphasis on "the algorithm", where users have very little control over what they see. This infinite feed of content can lead to "doomscrolling", which [studies have suggested is linked to poor mental and physical health](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/06/doomscrolling-linked-to-poor-physical-and-mental-health-study-finds).

The aim of Mellon is to focus on friendships - no algorithm, no influencers, no infinite feed, no adverts or sponsored posts. It will act as something inbetween a social network and a diary, where users can share short posts that are seen only by their friends, and can conversely check their friends' posts. The site will also provide functionality for liking and commenting on posts, as well as direct messaging users, in order to further facilitate human connection in the digital age.

### Side Note - Why Mellon?

Mellon is the Elvish word for 'friend' in Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" - and besides, who doesn't love a juicy melon on a summer day? Simple as that!

# Planning Stage

## Target Audience

The target audience of Mellon mainly consists of young people, 16-30, who are tired of sites like Twitter and are looking for a simpler way to connect with friends.
